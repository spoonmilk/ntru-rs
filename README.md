# Tanish and Alex Protect the Internet

## HI GRADER! YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHY THERE ISN'T REALLY ANY ONION ROUTING HERE.

Turns out, implementing a complete encryption scheme from scratch with no dependencies
is sorta tough! Tanish and I learned this the hard way.
Still, we hope you'll appreciate the amount of work we've done to create the first ever
pure Rust implementation of the NTRU cryptographic scheme and a small handshake host-router
communication using it.
